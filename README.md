# React, React Native, and Next.js Playground - maintained by Quang Pham

This repository serves as a playground for exploring and experimenting with ReactJS, Next.js, and their surrounding ecosystem. It's a space where I actively track the latest developments, apply best practices, and implement cutting-edge features.

## Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

1. To stay up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements in React and Next.js
2. To experiment with new features and APIs as they are released
3. To implement and refine best practices in modern web development
4. To serve as a reference for future projects and learning

## Key Focus Areas

- React 18+ features (e.g., Concurrent Mode, Suspense, Server Components)
- Next.js 14+ App Router and related features
- React Native 0.75+ and related features (Expo, React Native CLI)
- State management solutions (e.g., React Query, Zustand)
- Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) techniques
- Performance optimization strategies
- TypeScript integration and best practices
- Modern styling approaches (e.g., CSS-in-JS, Tailwind CSS)
- Testing methodologies and tools
- Accessibility (a11y) considerations and implementations

This repository contains various examples, mini-projects, and experiments. Each folder or section focuses on a specific concept or feature, making it easy to navigate and reference specific implementations.

## Contributions

While this is primarily a personal learning repository, suggestions, issues, and pull requests are welcome. If you spot an improvement or want to suggest a new area of exploration, feel free to contribute!

## Disclaimer

This is an evolving project. Code here may be experimental and not production-ready. Always refer to official documentation and best practices when implementing features in production environments.

Happy coding and learning!
